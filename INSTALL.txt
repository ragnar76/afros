  Debian/Ubuntu network setup:
  ----------------------------
  For running on a Debian/Ubuntu based system with networking enabled
  please add the following section to your /etc/network/interfaces file:

  auto tap0
  iface tap0 inet static
	address 192.168.251.1
	pointopoint 192.168.251.2
	netmask 255.255.255.255
	tunctl_user YOUR_LOGIN_NAME
	up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.251.2 -j MASQUERADE
	down iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 192.168.251.2 -j MASQUERADE
	up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

  Don't forget to replace the YOUR_LOGIN_NAME with your login name. Then
  restart the networking with "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart".


  Generic Linux network setup:
  ----------------------------
  Enter the following commands in a shell as root, replace YOUR_LOGIN_NAME
  with the user's login name that will be starting the ARAnyM (i.e. yours)

  modprobe tun
  chown YOUR_LOGIN_NAME /dev/net/tun
  sleep 1
  tunctl -t tap0 -u YOUR_LOGIN_NAME
  sleep 1
  ifconfig tap0 192.168.251.1 pointopoint 192.168.251.2 netmask 255.255.255.255 up
  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.251.2 -j MASQUERADE
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
  

  Other ARAnyM host operating systems:
  ------------------------------------
  Instructions for setting up networking on Mac OS X and MS Windows
  ARAnyM hosts can be found/edited at http://wiki.aranym.org/


  FreeMiNT DNS setup:
  -------------------
  AFROS needs to know the correct IP address of your DNS server. In most
  Linux/Unix operating systems this can be achieved by the following command:

  "grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf > drive_c/etc/resolv.conf"
