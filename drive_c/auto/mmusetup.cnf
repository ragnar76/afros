# To define a block of logical addressing area, used to build the translation
# tree, the following variables are used for each block you wich to define.
# logical  - The logical start address of the block to define
# physical - The physical start address of the block. The logical and physical
#            addresses are set equal in most cases. The CPU always uses logical
#            addresses to access memory, and then uses to tranlation tree to
#            obtain the actual physical address of that memory.
# size     - The size of the block.
# pd_flags - This is used to set initial flags in the page descriptors, as the
#            tree is built. For example  the caching mode is set using this flag.
# These are the following flags you can use with pd_flags. It is highly
# recommended you only use this to set the cache-mode, unless you know what you
# do!
#
# - The following flags are understood, but not used! pdt_r1 is always forced
# - into the pdt field of page descriptors. Also, SET_MMU can not create
# - indirect page descriptors at this time!
#
# pdt_iv    - Page Descriptor Type = invalid  ( %00 )
# pdt_r1    - ------- "" --------  = Resident ( %01 ) This is the pdt value set
#                                                     by SET_MMU.
# pdt_r2    - ------- "" --------  = Resident ( %11 )
# pdt_id    - ------- "" --------  = Indirect ( %10 )
#
# - The following flags can all be set at will, but dont do that unless you know
# - why you do it ;-)
#
# wp            - Write Protect, the Page is write protected
# used          - Used.
# modified      - Modified.
# super         - Page is supervisor accessible only.
# upa_0 - upa_3 - Sets the user page attribute field to 0,1,2 or 3
# global        - Global.
# ur1/ur2       - Sets the User reserved bit 11 (ur1) and 12 (ur2).
#
# The we have the caching modes..
#
# c_wt   - Cachable, Writetrought. Sets Writetrought caching.
# c_cb   - Cachable, CopyBack. Sets Copyback caching.
# c_p    - Cache inhibit, Precise exception model.
# c_ip   - Cache inhibit, ImPrecise exception model.
#
# All logical address spaces not defined by these blocks are marked INVALID in
# the translation tree.
#
# IMPORTANT: There *MUST* be an empty line between translation definition blocks!!
