BetaDOS x:\dev filesystem driver
================================

The dev.dos is a driver that creates the u:\dev folder known from the
FreeMiNT and MagiC environment. The motivation is to create identical
environment by which any HW dependent access is encapsulated. That
approach is present in UNIX-like environments and is present in
FreeMiNT as its fundamental concept.

The aim is to make developers provide special driver for any HW (or
NF which is considered to be OS only acces feature) they create. Such
driver would make it possible to create an equivalent on another
machine with the same interface and would automaticaly impose some
level of reusability. So for TOS environments one would create BetaDOS
.BOS device driver and for FreeMiNT .XDD device driver.

This dev.dos driver automatically scans any .BOS driver loaded by
BetaDOS and creates appropriate x:\dev\bos folder entry for each.
It also asks the particular .BOS driver for an information whether
it should also be placed into the x:\dev under its name.
(FIXME: provide another ioctl() to provide better name?).

Just install it to the bdconfig.sys e.g. as:
...
*BOS, \auto\nfstderr.bos, E

*DOS, c:\auto\dev.dos, X:2
...

And you will get:

X:\dev\bos\E
X:\dev\nfstderr

Ehere the nfstderr is actually like a hardlink to the bos\E entry.

More documentation to come on this topic.
