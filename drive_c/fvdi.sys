# ----- Various fixes -----

# With this uncommented fVDI can use NVDI as a background VDI (for
# dealing with non-screen devices). Some strange problems still
# remain, though.
#nvdifix

# Some programs look in the lineA variables for certain information.
# Uncomment this to make fVDI do a few more changes there.
#lineafix

# With this uncommented fVDI will make the XBIOS report the correct
# screen address even if using a graphics card. There are still
# problems with this.
#xbiosfix


# ----- Advanced setup -----

# Specify the 'roundness' of circles/ellipses/arcs.
# The split number indicates how many lines will be drawn as a
# percentage of the largest ellipse radius. The min/max numbers
# make sure that not too few or too many lines are used.
# More lines will result in slower drawing.
# Defaults are as in the original VDI (the GPLed sources).
#arcsplit 25
#arcmin 8
#arcmax 256

# Uncomment this to force fVDI to make do with a single Trap #2
# bending. Normally fVDI tries to move itself forward in the vector
# chains, but this might cause trouble together with some other TSR.
#singlebend

# Unless this is uncommented, fVDI tries to allocate memory as itself
# rather than the calling application under normal TOS.
# This option might possibly be useful if fVDI is launched before
# MiNT.
#nopidalloc

# If this is uncommented, fVDI will refrain from keeping a list of all
# allocated memory blocks. This option is useful if fVDI is launched
# before MiNT running with memory protection.
#nomemlink

# Uncomment this to disable all the VDI vector functions (vex_).
#novex

# Uncomment this to force fVDI to not rely on a previous VDI.
# For now, this will mean no mouse support...
#standalone

# The number of internal memory blocks allocated.
# Defaults to two, and there should normally be no reason to change
# that setting.
#blocks 2

# The size of the internal memory blocks in kbyte.
# Defaults to ten, which should normally be enough.
#blocksize 20


# ----- Debug setup -----

# This will turn on a few debug features in fVDI if uncommented.
# If something bombs, the information given at startup (this is before
# fVDI is running, so it will be on the normal Atari screen) using
# this, together with what for example ERR_RPRT.PRG shows, is very
# useful.
# Multiple 'debug' turns on more debug output/features.

# ----- Driver configuration -----

# Common driver initialization options (any driver can add to these):
# accelerate xxxxxxx
#     Any soft- or hardware accelerations can be turned off using the
#     'accelerate xxxxxxx' option. For any 'x' that is replaced by a
#     '-' or a '0', the corresponding accelerated function will be
#     turned off.
#     If this option is not used, all acceleration will be on.
#     Acceleration possibilities (in order):
#        line expand fillpoly fill blit text mouse
# oldmouse
#     Well, this switch is actually needed here too.

# The standard software accelerated drivers all recognize
# shadow
#     Use a separate buffer of the screen in RAM. This is not useful
#     unless you have a really fast processor ('040) and RAM that can
#     be accessed much faster than the screen.

# The ARAnyM driver recognizes
# mode WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH@FREQUENCY
#     Sets a mode as close to (but not higher) the given numbers as
#     possible.
# realones
#     Do not special case all zero/one blit types in true colour mode.
#     Often better left inactive.
# assumenf
#     Use NatFeat without checking for cookie.
# scrninfo fb
#     Make vq_scrninfo return values regarding actual fb layout.
# debug
#     Turn on debugging aids.
