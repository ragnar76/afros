                 Modular conversion tables for use with aMail
                 --------------------------------------------
                     
   Here are files used as source tables for charset encoding. Every
file with .tbl suffix is loaded and that file must follow following
rules:

1) plain text file (no control bytes)
2) first line is a name of charset
3) next lines are composed from 4-byte key, space and hexa-number
   The conversion is one-way if a char '%' is the first one on the line.

example:
iso-8859-2
a' E1
o' F3

next file:
KAMENICKA
o' A2
a' A0

or example of conversion table with one-way coded bytes:
us-ascii
%o' 6F
%a' 61
''  27

Warning: Outgoing messages must be in any ISO-8859-XX charset!
