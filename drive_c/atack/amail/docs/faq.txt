								Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
									
									
1) Q: Does aMail work on MagiC ?
   A: Primary aMail development & testing environment is MiNT/N.AES.
aMail has also been tested by several people running MagiC/STinG/qed and
they reported it worked fine. However, we do not provide support for
aMail on MagiC and we do not guarantee future versions of aMail will
work on it.

2) Q: I can't send mails (after having edited it, nothing happens in aMail).
What shall I do?
	A: You probably didn't read aMail documentation. Please start over and
read the section about software requirements.
