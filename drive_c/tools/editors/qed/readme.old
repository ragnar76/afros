
   From version 3.09 qed (including sources) will be in the public domain!

Thus, both the program and the sources of version 3.09 may be copied 
by everybody and may be freely distributed by bulletin board systems 
etc.
Yet the Tom has prohibited the charge of a fee of whatever kind.

=========================================================================

I - Christian Felsch - am the maintainer of the current version. I
will also continue the development of qed in the future.  However, 
everybody is welcome to support me, which is easily done, because I 
always publish my versions with the complete sources.

My version of qed can be found at:

This archive (qed-XXXen.lzh) only contains the english components of qed,
translated readme's, hypertext and resource file.
For installing qed you also need the language-independet parts of qed (e.g
qed.app and tag files) from the german base archive (qed-XXX.lzh)!!
