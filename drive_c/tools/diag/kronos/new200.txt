New in Kronos 2.00

- Support for coldfire V4E CPU (tests: VDI, Opengl, FPU natives, other native lib: screen.ldg)
- Separation of libs for OpenGL tests and "Mother board speed" evaluation, 
now opengl result are only evaluate on tests with display, tests without display
is reserved to "Mother board speed", it's now impossible to change dynamic lib
for this second test while it is alway's possible for the first test.
