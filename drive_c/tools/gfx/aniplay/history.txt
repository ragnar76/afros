September-October 1995:
-----------------------
Creation of program.  The object is to make the fastest possible player under
GEM, optimised for FALCON True Color mode.  To obtain maximum speed, it is
programmed in assembler, and uses the DSP.

V2.0 February 1998:
-------------------
- With Falcon & DSP, reduced by 90% the chance of getting the message
"Cannot load the block to be compressed into DSP memory" for cvid
(Radius Cinepak) AVI/MOV files.
- Add support for AVR (Atari), WAV (PC), and AIF (Mac) sound files.
- Add JPEG image display.
- Add volume control.
- Add QuickTime VR in a GEM window (thanks to Guillaume Tello).
- Support MagiC hide function.
- Improved recognition of QuickTime files (thanks to Guillaume Tello).
- Support NOVA True Color card.
- Fix bug with some MOV files: no sound or sound is at the end
(thanks to Raymond Collins).
- Fix jpeg decompression.
- Fix jpeg size tests in AVI/MOV files (thanks to Cl‚ment Benrabah).
- Fix iv32 (Intel Indeo) decompression: some images with headers
only caused problems (thanks to Cl‚ment Benrabah).
- Save image flag reset to zero if save interrupted.
- Replaced MOVEP instruction for YAMAHA and PSOUND card routines because
this instruction doesn't exist on the 68060.
- Fix saving of FLI images (the starting number was the current image).
- Fix saving images with direct display (the image of the file selector
appeared instead of the true image, thanks to Christian Marillat).
- Fix possible crash when using the 'Skip images' option if there is
no sound; this problem existed since version 1.21.

V2.1 April 1998:
----------------

detected (DOLMEN!).  If LineA is not available, TOS mode is not supported
and VDI is used for GEM.
- The ESC key or the closer button quits the program only if the 'Quit
at end' option is selected; otherwise, the movie is topped and the window
is closed.
- The DAC is reconnected to the matrix each time the sound is restarted
(with the XBIOS function soundcmd(ADDRIN,13)), because some programs
occasionally disconnect it.
- Improved statistics.
- Sliders on window if size of image is greater than the desktop.
- Add save block for sound (same as pictures).
- Sound Driver for MAC (MagicSound). 
- Improved 256 colour dithering (video resolutions <= 256 colours) of
movies in 16M or 32768 colours, by useing a 1MB precalculated table
(8x8 Bayer filter).  The buffer is only allocated for 256 colours (option
is disabled for lower video resolutions or insufficient memory).

- The AVI iv31/iv32 format is now always treated as 16 million colours
(although some files are marked as 65K colours).
- In an AVI file, if the index table read does not complete, the
program no longer issues the message "Abnormal end of file" (thanks
to Jo Vandeweghe).
- Fix image frequency for files without sound (or with sound turned
off) with the 'Skip images' option checked.

- Fix problem reading AVI files with a bad division of sound and
images; in this case the sound is now preloaded.  If there is not enough
memory to handle 16-bit sound on the Falcon, the program retries with
8-bit sound before suggesting reading without sound (thanks to Nicolas
Richeton).
- The D2D option is deactivated when the sound is preloaded for AVI and
QuickTime files, and reactivated after the sound is stopped (e.g. by

interrupted during playback.
- Fix slide-show loop with one type of file under TOS.
- For sound files, the file is now read normally even if the 'Turn off
sound' option is checked.
- Mxalloc() is now always used if it exists (previously it was only used
for DMA sound, for the Falcon Videl, and for global memory allocation for
messages between applications).
- New option 'No error messages' causes the suppression of the skip alerts 
box and the error 'Abnormal end of file'.
- New option 'Pause at start'.
- Add Drag & Drop.
- The HOME environment variable is now used for saving ANIPLAY.INF.  The
file is also saved in the program folder; when reading, the most recent
version is used.
- Add save window positions (in ANIPLAY.INF).
- Add display of filename in information line for AVR/WAV/RA audio
files.
- Uses AVSERVER to open a desktop window if you press SHIFT when you
load a file (message AV_XWIND); tested with MAGXDESK and AVSERVER.

  +xnnnnn, +ynnnnn: position (max 5 numbers, centred by default)
- The screen is not erased if an 'MP' message contains the +x/+y options,
or VA_START is issued with a command line.
- With the DSP, VBL interrupts are only blocked during transfer if the
'Without GEM' option is specified.
- New 24-bit true colour motorola format supported with some graphics
cards: RRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGBBBBBBBB.
- Real Audio 28.8K is supported (a floating point coprocessor is required,
sound is decompressed before playing if CPU < 68060).
- If a .RAM file is passed to the player (via VA_START for example),
containing an address pnm://xxx.yyy/zzz.ra (pointing to a Real Audio
file), the address corrected to http://xx.yyy/zzz.ra is passed to a
web browser (specified via the environment variable BROWSER).  The
browser should then in theory load the Real Audio file and use the
player to play it (assuming the browser has Aniplayer declared to
handle .RA and .RAM files).

for renaming the target file if it already exists.
- Fix force XBIOS sound when read from .INF file (thanks to Odd
Skancke).
- Fix initialisation of sound volume control in 'Without GEM' mode.
- Fix read of number of images/second from MPEG header.
- Stop Playlist if used as plug-in with OLGA.
- More tolerance of variations in MPEG audio file headers (thanks to
Paul Nurminen).
- Add test for 'Xing' tag in MPEG VBR audio files to determine the
average bit-rate, so that file information is consistent (thanks to
Claude Labelle).
- The Playlist is now stopped if an error occurs while reading one of
the files.
- Add support for return message for VA_START (like 'MP'), at the end
of reading a file.
- Suppress erasing mouse pointer with a command line in TTP mode, when
the +x or +y parameter is present.
- Stop using Trap #5 instead of Supexec(), and LineA for the mouse
cursor (this actually speeded up the program).
- Save Timer B, used on the Falcon for MPEG audio, and the detection
of the external clock (causes problems with SYNCFIX, thanks to John
Banbury).
- Extended support for sound driver (MilanBlaster for example) via
test of bit 5 of '_SND' cookie (thanks to Odd Skancke).
- Handle changing DMA buffer (interruption) for GSXB sound driver
(Hades).
- Improve Playlist (Drag & Drop, and number/index display).
- New option in display configuration box to display only I-Frames of
MPEG movies (one way of reducing the CPU load).
- Add sound handling for MPEG video files; in this case the DSP is
used for the sound (unless 'Turn off sound' is checked).
- Add save MP2 sound for MPEG video files with sound.

V2.13 October 2000:
-------------------
- Fix test of D2D buffer size for MPEG audio VBR files during
playback; if the buffer is too small, an error message is issued
(thanks to Claude Labelle).
- Fix DSP decompression of MP1 mono (broken since version 2.11).
- Fix handling of MP2 stereo sound with DMA->DSP transfers, in the
case where 'Force mono' was checked in the sound configuration box
(thanks to Xavier Joubert).
- Fix Drag & Drop under MagiC Mac (fast machine only?) (thanks to
Sylvain Perchaud).
- Fix horizontal alignment of Microsoft rgb8 AVI files (thanks to
Benjamin Genevay).
- Fix search path for N_FRENCH.TXT, which is now the path of the
program directory, and no longer the current directory.
- Fix determination of program directory.  Under some circumstances
the default Playlist PLAYLIST.LST was not loaded.
- Fix occasional erroneous VU-meter display.
- Fix index table read (image and sound offsets) on certain AVI
files (thanks to Nicolas Richeton).
- StarTrack card priority over MilanBlaster on the Milan.
- Test for MagiC 6 to allow a long info line in the main window
(MagiC 4 causes problems with certain long info lines associated
with MPEG audio files, thanks to Nicolas Richeton).
- Using Drag and Drop to insert files in the Playlist no longer
inserts in reverse order.
- Add Drag and Drop of the contents of a directory to the Playlist.
- Recognition of AIF files generated by Cubase Audio, whose header
differs from normal AIF files (thanks to Benjamin Genevay).
- Reduce memory consumption for MPEG audio files with D2D.
- Fix MPEG loop which caused the message "Not enough memory for
resampling".
- For Falcon, add checksum test for MP2/3 DMA->DSP transfers when
'No error messages' is not checked.  Applies to CT2 or if the CPU is
greater than a 68030 (for example, AB040).
- Allow loading a Playlist with the LST extension via VA_START or by
Drag and Drop in the main window or the Playlist window.
- Add option +jnnnnnnnnnn to the command line in TTP mode to send an
address extension (to the +a command) to control the program, like
the 'AP' message.
- Progressive JPEG recognised but not yet handled.
- Add option +n for VA_START to add a name to the Playlist.  Other
options are ignored if the main window is playing a file; otherwise
playback starts with the new options and at the same time the file is
added to the Playlist.  This option causes other command line options
to be ignored.
- Add GEMJing compatible options -dnnnnn -q -rnnnnn for VA_START and
command line processing (with VDI and GEM), to play audio files
without a GEM window.
  -dnnnnn: Delay.  Sets a delay of nnnnn seconds (5 digits max)
           between each repeat.  -d0 corresponds to no delay.  If
           the option -d is not specified, it is treated as -d0.
  -q:      Quit.  Play one file and quit the program.
           The menu bar disappears.
  -rnnnnn: Repeat.  The sample is played nnnn times (5 digits max).
           -r1 means that the file will be played once, -r0 means
           indefinitely.  If the option -r is not specified, it is
           treated as -r1.
You must specify either -dnnnnn or -rnnnnn (at least) to cause the
player to ignore its command line and use that of GEMJing because of
the conflict with Aniplayer options.  The message GEMJING_RETURN is
sent.
- For audio files, the option 'Minimal window' now suppresses display
of the main window.
- Add automatic repeat of FF and REW buttons in the main window;
these buttons are now present when the option 'Tape recorder look'
is not checked.
- Certain windowed dialog boxes no longer block playback.
- The right-button popup now appears in a window.
- Add right-button popup to Playlist.
- Add left alignment of 4 columns of the Playlist via the popup.
- Add selection of small font for the Playlist display, via the
popup.
- Add GEMscript support; the following commands are supported:
  * AppGetLongName()          Returns the program name.
  * CheckCommand(command)     Tests the command.
  * Close()                   Close the file.
  * ControlKey(key)           Similar to AV_SENDKEY message.
  * ControlPlay(mode[,val])   Similar to 'AP' message.
  * Copy()                    Copy image to clipboard.
  * Ff(sec)                   Fast forward X seconds.

  * GetAllCommands()          Lists commands.
  * GetAuthor()               Return author info (from ID3 tag).
  * GetFilePlayed()           Return the file being played.
  * GetListTrack()            Return the 'track' being played
                              and the Playlist total.
  * GetTitle()                Return title info (from ID3 tag).
  * GetYear()                 Return year info (ID3 tag).
  * ListPlay()                Start Playlist playback.
  * ListStop()                Stop Playlist playback.

  * Play()                    Resume playback.
  * Quit()                    Quit Aniplayer.
  * Rew(sec)                  Rewind X seconds.
  * Save(path+name)           Save as AVI/MOV/AVR/WAV/AIF
                              according to the VA_START option +o.

V2.14 January 2001:
-------------------
- Fix bug with MP2 at 32000 Hz (thanks to Clement Benrabah).
- Fix forcing XBIOS sound when reading .INF file.
- Fix handling of MPEG video files, certain blocks could not be re-read.
- Fix reading ID3 header of MPEG audio file, file not recognised) if it
exceeded 16 KB (thanks to Claude Labelle).
- Fix option +o in the command line in TTP mode with the 'Without GEM'
option (broken since previous version).
- Fix possible crash with command line in TTP mode for registered users.
- Fix file decription when adding a file to the Playlist with the MagiC
file selector in a window (thanks to Joachim Fornallaz).
- Fix redraw problems (illegal AES calls) with WINX which sends messages
even when the window is closed (thanks to Martin Christoph).
- Fix refresh of horizontal slider in main window.
- Fix possible sound file loop, with the option 'Minimal window' (to
suppress the playback window), in GEMJing mode.
- Ctrl-U now stops both the Playlist and the slide-show.
- Force D2D for AVI files if automatic sound preload is impossible due
to lack of memory (thanks to David Olivares).
- Allow up to 256 entries in Playlist with 3-digit display.
_ Handle QuickTime files in multiple languages (different sound tracks)
(thanks to Ekkehard Flessa).
- Fix DMA playback counter with MilanBlaster (problem with the XBIOS
Buffptr function) (thanks to Ekkehard Flessa and Eric Reboux).
- Fix problem with AV_SENDKEY message (thanks to Claude Labelle).
- Fix detection of GEMJing command line (thanks to Martin Christoph).
- Handle long names with spaces enclosed by '' with the +o option,
for command line, VA_START, or GEMScript Open().
- Use Xgem protocol to display an icon in the title bar of each window
under MagiC (uses SLB from Eric Reboux Software: http://ers.free.fr).
- The MagiC (or compatible) font selector replaces the small font
option for the Playlist, where available.
- Add new Playlist modification box when left alignment is selected via
the popup.
- Add DSP statistics DSP for MPEG Audio with DMA->DSP transfers.
- Optimise DSP part of MP3 processing: the average DSP load is 64% for
an MP3 44.1 kHz joint-stereo file and a DSP at 50MHz, so it's about the
limit for listening to these files in stereo with a DSP at 32 MHz (a
CT60 for example if you do not use another oscillator for the DSP).
- The 'Quality' option now is used for MP3 with or without DSP:
  * With the CPU, when this option is checked the quality is better,
    but decompression is slower (a few percent).
  * With the DSP, when this option is checked the quality is equal
    to V2.13, and when this option is unchecked the quality is better
    than V2.14 and worse than V2.13.
- Add virtual screen when changing resolution 'Without GEM' on the
Falcon if the screen exceeds the maximum size for True Color:
  * VGA 384 x 304 32 MHz (internal or external clock).
  * VGA 640 x 480 CenTurbo 2 50 MHz.
  * TV 640 x 480.
- Add audio DVSM format (Falcon Winrec): uncompressed, delta packed,
voice packed.

V2.15 April 2001:
-----------------
- Fix problem in Playlist update box with left alignment: if the first
two lines were too long, the form was damaged (possible crash).
- Fix saving MPEG video file sound in MP2 file (broken since previous
version).
- Fix problem reading an MPEG file greater than 524 MB; changed maximum
file size to 4 GB.
- Fix possible Videl screen buffer overflow using 'Without GEM' on
Falcon.
- Fix loop reading audio file with the 'Minimal window' option checked.
- Fix possible program crash handling Playlist.
- Fix problem when changing options for MPEG videos (initialising DSP
for use with sound or images).
- Fix inconsistent handling of MPEG file if a WAV file of the same name
is found even though it does not exist (problem occurs with ExtenDOS
Gold v3.3B and v3.3C).
- If a line in the Playlist refers to a non-existent file it is now
greyed out when the Playlist is read.
- Suppress restoring palette for sound files or files without images.
- The 'MP3 quality' option (created in v2.14a) is now separate from the
general 'Quality' option (the MP3 quality option replaces the general
quality option in the right popup and the main menu).  You can change
this option when an MP3 file is played and save it (the two quality
options are saved separately).
- On the Falcon when 'Without GEM' is checked, the right mouse button
gives the same results as the 'Esc' key.
- Filenames internal to the program are now in lower case (for example
aniplay.inf).
- Add keyboard shortcuts '(' and ')' for the previous and next buttons
in the Playlist.
- Add block management; you can select a block with a shift-click or
double-click in the elapsed time display, or with the right-click
popup of the main window.  The functions provided are:
 * Play block.
 * Mark start of block.
 * Mark end of block.
The length of the block is automatically filled in if a save box is
opened.
- Add function 'INTRO' to the Playlist, to read the first 10 seconds
of files.
- The Playlist popup menu accesible via the right mouse button now
provides two choices for save: with the current name, or with a new name
via the file selector.
- Add extra information in the event of a DSP communication error.  The
error 'Cannot synchronize DSP' could sometimes appear instead of 'Error
communicating with DSP'.
- On the Falcon using 'Without GEM', MPEG videos with a size of 352 x 240
are now displayed in a screen 320 x 240.
- Fix virtual screen display for certain screen sizes on the Falcon when
using 'Without GEM'.
- Faster display of MPEG videos with I/P/B frames when 'I-frames only' is
selected in the display configuration box: the DSP writes directly to the
screen memory (if it's not being used for the sound).
- Add option in display configuration box to display 1/4 of the I-frames
for MPEG video files (for large display sizes the speed is increased and
it's the only way to listen to sound without repeats).
- Optimise MPEG video decompression without DSP (20% faster for I-frames
and 10% for P and B frames).
- Optimise DSP part of MP3 processing; with the quality option removed,
all MP3 44.1 kHz files are played in stereo on a FALCON with a DSP at
32 MHz (CT60 or a normal FALCON).  There is an average CPU load of 15%
on my CT2B using MP3 44.1 kHz files.  The 68000 part of processing is
also faster; this is especially visible on a normal Falcon.
- Optimise DSP part of MP2 processing (it's important for video MPEGs
with sound ;-) ).  There is an average CPU load of 4% on my CT2B using
MP2 44.1 kHz files.

V2.16 June 2001:
----------------
- Fix memory violation under MiNT with the GSXB driver.
- Fix CPU load display with MP3 VBR files.
- Fix problems with the 'preload sound' mode and MP3 VBR files.
- Fix problems with the DMA -> DSP transfers possible with the audio
track of some MPEG video files.
- Fix crash with the audio track of MPEG video files after the 1st
DMA block.
- Fix crash with MagiC 6 file selector, fslx_do() seems not like
the default sorting.
- Fix the test if the file exits for the saving, now the test works
with long names.
- Add reading of keyboard under FALCON and 'without GEM' option 
during saving.
- Add MP3 export with the libmp3lame (www.mp3dev.org). An FPU is
required and you must install the shared library LAME_ENC.SLB on 
your system: MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or MetaDOS 2.74 (or more).
This SLB can only used by one process in the same time.
- Add codec OpenDivX for AVI files, this codec uses the library
libdivxdecore (www.projectmayo.com). You must install the shared 
libray OPENDIVX.SLB on your system: MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or 
MetaDOS 2.74 (or more). This SLB can only used by one process in
the same time.
- Add Codec MPEG Audio Layer 1,2,3 for AVI files.

V2.17 August 2001:
------------------
- Fix minimum X,Y of popup-menus.
- It's only possible to use MPEG frequency for LAME_ENC.SLB
(8000,11025,12000,16000,22050,24000,32000,44100,48000 Hz), so now
there are a test for remove the message 'buffer too small'. The
player choose the frequency near +/- 5% than the audio source,
out of this window there are a new error message.
- Fix the frequency selection inside the MP3 export box.
- Fix the calcul of size for the screen buffer on the FALCON
and the 'without GEM' mode, risk of crash for videos > 320 x 240.
- Fix system locked during the last block played in D2D with the
XBIOS sound functions (possible with MagiCMac and MacSound).
- Fix the window redraw in 32K/65K colors when the window is in 
background (problem under MagiCMac, hades, etc... not on FALCON).
- Fix test for the free ST-RAM under MagiCMac (ST-RAM is not
required for sound). An error message "Not enough memory for sound"
was possible.
- Fix the saturation of sound possible with MPEG Audio layer 1,2,3
files without DSP.
- Fix crash possible of the VDI, when ignore is selected inside the
error message "Unknown compression type", zone of display null in this
case.
- Fix display of JPEG monochromes pictures for screen in 16M colors.
- The size of ID3 tag for MPEG Audio files is not limited to 16 KB.
Unknown compression type
- The directory of Aniplayer is not send to the system if the SLB
is not found in the same directory, because the variable SLBPATH
not worked under MiNT. 
- The slider of the main window is displayed during the repetition
of the rew and ff buttons.
- The zoom 2X without GEM isn't limited to 320 x 240 pixels.
- Add automatic delay for pictures (up to 50 frames) for play
correctly some movies AVI or QuickTime who the sound was late
in comparison with pictures. This delay works only when 'Skip 
images' is checked.
- Add shared library JPEG from libjpeg 6 of the Independent JPEG
Group (www.ijg.org) for the JPEG export in the save image box and
the display of progressive JPEG. You must install the shared libray
JPG.SLB on your system: MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or MetaDOS 2.74 (or
more).
- It's possible to put a background picture inside the main window and 
the Playlist.

V2.18 December 2001:
--------------------
- Fix the test of the disk free for a size > 2 GB.
- Fix reading of the MPEG sound track when 'Without D2D' is checked, 
there was no sound since the version 2.16.
- Fix starting block played of audio files when 'Pause at start' is 
checked (thanks to Christian Villard of Ornacieux).
- Fix moving of the cursor with the preload sound used for big files.
- Fix dithering in 256 colors on the RLE compression and the FLH 
files (bug since the version 2.1, thanks to Fran‡ois le Coat). 
- After the last fix of the system locked during the last block played 
in D2D with the XBIOS sound functions, fix the reading with one sound 
block like the preload sound (problem under MagiCMac).
- Background picture inside the main window removed for the plug-in 
with OLGA.
- 'Speed control' test removed for the audio files.
- Add load and save configuration from file selector (*.INF).
- fVDI detected and the specific raster format changed (bit 
organization) inside the VDI function vro_cpyfm (Motorola -> Intel 
format), in this case 'Direct display' is disabled and the informations 
about the bit organization with the VDI function vq_scrninfo are ignored.
Before this version the GEM display in window was no good with fVDI. The
screen's adress is found with vq_scrninfo and not the XBIOS functions
Logbase/Physbase.
- Better synchronisation between sound track and video track for MPEG
files.
- Add GEMScript command SaveImages(path,type,start_frame,end_frame).
- Add MPEG movies inside QuickTime format.
- Add shared library Vorbis from libvorbis-1.0rc2 (www.vorbis.com)
for read OGG sound files. You must install the shared libray VORBIS.SLB
on your system: MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or MetaDOS 2.74 (or more).

V2.19 February 2002:
--------------------
- Fix memory free test for compressed sound buffer, risk of crash 
before this version if the memory free isn't enough.
- Fix problem with MP2 sound track on some MPEG video files (thanks 
to Cl‚ment Benrabah).
- Fix the size for the MP2 sound buffer with the DSP and the MPEG 
movies, that can cause DSP errors since the better synchronisation 
between sound track and video track of the version 2.19.
- Fix display in the main window 'DSP used' when the DSP not exist 
inside the machine and when the option 'Tape recorder look' is 
changed (thanks to Peter Slegg).
- Fix sound playing (problem with timming) with an MPEG file if a WAV 
file with the same name is found in the same directory and when an 
audio track exist in this MPEG file.
- Fix horizontal alignment with the option in display configuration 
box to display 1/4 of the I-frames for MPEG video files with screen 
in 32/65K colors.
- Reading an audio MP3 track of an AVI file caused an MPEG audio error
after an MPEG movie played with 'without D2D' checked.
- Display progress of decompression in % on menu bar when preloading
the sound of an AVI or QuickTime file.
- Add automatic delay for pictures (up to 50 frames) for play
correctly some movies QuickTime without section 'stss' (all pictures 
are key-frames, for exemple with the compression JPEG used) who the 
sound was late in comparison with pictures. This delay works only when 
'Skip images' is checked.
- New version of the SLB OpenDivX, based on the latest library 
(ProjectMayo libdivxdecore 0.5.0), this library isn't compatible with 
the old version. This version of Aniplayer require this library version. 
All the divx4 AVI files must be displayed. You must install the shared 
libray OPENDIVX.SLB on your system: MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or 
MetaDOS 2.74 (or more).
- Add preload sound without decompression for some AVI files (bad 
encoding), this allows read the files encoded in divx with an audio 
MP3 track stored in the end of this AVI file. The only problem is the  
memory used, for example with an AVI divx file of 700 MB, the MP3 
track can represent 60 MB that you must load before in memory ! So 
only an Hades, a CT60, or MagiCMac can uses this feature, otherwise 
this file is played without sound. 

V2.20 May 2002:
---------------
- Fix test identifier divx inside the QuickTime files.
- Fix test GEMJing command line.
- Fix display troubles with the dialog box in window during saving 
with the option 'Direct display' selected. 'Direct display' option 
now is inhibed during saving movie and pictures.
- Fix dialog box clipping for locked box.
- Delay between picture and sound removed with 'Preload sound' for AVI 
and QuickTime files.
- DSP instruction rep removed, this instruction was used with 'Without 
quality MP3'.
- For the 'Without GEM' display and the 'Direct display' options 
checked, without screen changed in 65K colors like the Falcon, now the 
fullscreen is possible with the VDI function vr_transfer_bits (NVDI 5  
compatible). This feature works only if the 'Size of display without 
GEM' inside the display configuration box is on 'Automatic'.
- Add tests Aranym et pixel format (NVDI 5 compatible) at start.
- Add shared library avcodec from libavcodec (ffmpeg.sourceforge.net). 
You must install the shared libray AVCODEC.SLB on your system: MiNT 
1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or MetaDOS 2.74 (or more). This library replace the  
OpenDivX library if the SLB is loaded with success, now Aniplayer can:
 * Play AVI/MOV compressed in mp43/div3/divx/div4 (divx3/4).
 * Play AVI/MOV compressed in mjpg/u263/i263.
 * Save AVI/MOV in divx3/4.
 * Play AC3 audio file and AVI with AC3 audio track (FPU used).
 * Save AC3 sound.
 * Save MP2 sound, if the SLB of libmp3lame isn't found, else with a 
 selection from a popup-menu MP2/MP3.
- The identifier 3iv2 is used like divx, because under Mac QuickTime 
3ivx replace the identifier divx by 3iv2. 
- Add yuv9 AVI/MOV saving.
- Add AC3 sound saving for AVI files with an AC3 sound track.
- Add MPEG Audio Layer 3 codec for QuickTime files.
- Add MPEG Audio saving for QuickTime files with an MPEG Audio track.

V2.21 October 2002:
-------------------
- Because the MP3 licence is changed ($15000 by year send to Thomson), 
MP3 support is removed (MP3 ignored and LAME_ENC.SLB removed of the 
archive).
- Aranym test removed.
- Beter synchronisation between Mpeg sound and frames inside AVI 
files. 
- Fix dithering in 256 colors with AVCODEC.SLB, pixel shift at each 
ligne (thanks to Pascal Ricard).
- Fix saving movie with a graphic card in 32768 colors with Intel 
format, the colors was wrong (thanks to Grzegorz Paulik).
- Fix saving movie in 256 colors with AVI/MOV files encoded in 
yuv9/divx3/4.
- Fix saving picture in 256 colors with TGA and JPG types, and with 
the current palette (choice inside the display configuration box), 
the palette was bad (thanks to Grzegorz Paulik).
- Fix copy picture, the selection must be at (X)IMG type before.
- Fix saving with AVI rle8, the palette was wrong since the version
2.20.
- Fix rgb16 (TC15) display in 256 colors.
- Fix display (problem with colors) of AVI mjpg.
- Add sort by title, author, album or time inside the Playlist window 
when the display is selected by columns (left alignment) by the popup
(right click).
- Add rgb16 format $03000000 (TC16 Intel) used by Funmedia and Adobe 
Premiere.
- New version of the SLB Avcodec, based on the current version 
(0.4.6): MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or MetaDOS 2.74 (or more). This is 
a list of new codecs supported:
 * AVI/MOV files compressed in svq1 (Sorenson Video) played.
 * AVI/MOV files compressed in div1/mpg4 et div2/mp42 (MS DivX V1/2).
 * AVI/MOV files compressed in dx50 (DivX 5).
- Add Real Media (RM) reading, only RV10 (Real Video 1) codec is 
supported with the SLB Avcodec.
- New version of the SLB Vorbis, basd on the current librairy (1.0), 
and also the 'Tremor' integers version (32/64 bits), the 68060 version 
use the FPU: MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or MetaDOS 2.74 (or more).
- Add shared library Vorbis Encoder from libvorbisenc-1.0 
(www.vorbis.com) for encode OGG sound files. An FPU is required and 
you must install the shared library VORBIS_ENC.SLB on your system: 
MiNT 1.15.3 or MagiC 6 or MetaDOS 2.74 (or more). 

V2.22 June 2004:
----------------
- Fix measure of video clock with an RGB monitor on a FALCON for 
display without GEM with screen set in 65K colors.
- Fix counter in seconds during reading of an AC3 sound file.
- Fix formats AVI rgb16/24 (Microsoft, thanks to Peter Slegg).
