This program is ShareWare.  This program requires a software key
to fully unlock it.  Without the key you have 15 minutes of online time
to test the program.  Other than the time limit it is fully functional and
there are no disabled features.  When the time limit is reached the program
will let you know and then exit.  You can restart it as often as you like.

The shareware fee is a mere $5.  If you wish to send more, that's up to you
and I won't refuse it.  ;o)  Those that sent me a donation when aIRC was
not shareware should contact me for a free key.

I will accept PayPal or money orders in USD funds only.  You can send
cash if you wish, but should it get lost in the mail I cannot be held
responsible.

When you register, I need your full name and a valid e-mail address so
that I can deliver the key.

To register aIRC, you need to do the following:
  Send me $5 USD somehow.
  Start the new version of aIRC.
  Open the credit box, click 'AtarIRC Info' in the drop down menu.
  Enter the key code I have mailed you.
  Click the 'Register' button.
  That's it!

  I will not issue a key with a fake name or an alias.
  Your real name will not be used on the irc network, it is only contained
  in the key along with a unique serial number.

  You may move the key to any number of machines in your own home.
  Do not give out your key!  The key does contain your full name.

When reporting bugs please include the version number and a
detailed description of your system setup.
