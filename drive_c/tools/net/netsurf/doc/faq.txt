1.) Question:
    CAN NETSURF ALSO BE RUN WITHIN AN TOS ENVIRONMENT?

    Answer:
    Yes NS can run on classic TOS. More or less.
    It is intended to run within the FreeMint environment.
    However there is no support for networking
    right now. Networking support for FireTOS is maybe possible
    in the future.
    NS also has problems with Path conversions on all FileSystems
    running under TOS. Try setting full paths within the Choices file.


2.) Question:
    I DON'T HAVE AN 15 BIT GRAPHICS CARD, HOW TO RUN NETSURF ANYWAY?

    Answer:
    You need to trigger the config a bit.
	enable the following Choices settings:

    atari_font_driver:vdi
    atari_transparency:0
    suppress_images:1

    This will run netsurf as a bloat textmode browser :)

3.) Question:
    WHEN I WANT TO RUN NETSURF IT SAYS: "SOCKET NOT CONNECTED"

    Answer:
    Take a look at the system requirements! I statet NetSurf needs
    the latest FreeMiNT 1.17 RELEASE. There was a bug within previous
    Versions. Please update your kernel. OR install polipo proxy
    provided as RPM within sparemint distribution. This is an
    workaround, it should work out of the box. But if you want to
    use the polipo disk-cache you should edit the config file.

4.) Question:
    I'M GETTING "INSUFFICENT MEMORY" MESSAGES WHEN RUNNING NETSURF.

    Answer:
	Try to increase the TPA_INITIALMEM Configuration value within MINT.CNF

5.) Question:
    SSL DOES NOT WORK - WHAT TO DO?

    Answer:
    Try to move the shipped cabundle.crt file to the path where NetSurf
    looks for the SSL certificates (Displayed within statusbar and also
    verbose log).

6.) Question:
	I'M GETTING THE ERROR: "BASE STYLESHEET FAILED TO LOAD" - WHAT'S WRONG?

	Answer:
	NetSurf checks if the base stylesheet is modified. For that - it
	requires that the system clock is returning reasonable valid values.
	Make your your system clock is set. (Rember empty NVRAM....)
	If that doesn't help - make sure the netsurf package was unpacked
	completly and that all files can be read.
