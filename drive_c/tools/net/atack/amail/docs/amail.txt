aMail is a freeware GEM mail client for receiving, writing and sending mails
via InterNET. Its main features are:

o fully mouse controlled GEM program, smaller memory requirements 
  than other "texts" programs ported from U*nix
o works with MiNTNET - it doesn't need other TCP/IP sockets
o works with STinG/STiK
o works with Draconis
o works with IConnect
o has fully U*ix compatible mailboxes - you can fetch your mails from other 
  system from work or school
o uses SMTP, POP3 and NNTP protocols
o supports UUENCODE and BASE64
o supports MIME standard (you may save MIME attachments by drag&drop directly
  into the desktop thanks to VA protocol; sent attachments have a set type
  according to the file mime.types)
o ASCII configuration file, so you can edit it freely in a text editor
o you may define up to 44 mailboxes for sort your mail according to 
  given rules
o aMail hasn't own text editor - so you may use your favourite text editor,
  but it must support OLGA protocol (QED, Everest).
o supports AV, FONT, XFSL and UFSL
o understands VA_START
o parse URLs in messages (using URLserver - an utility from ATACK)
o support Czech language and other iso-8859-XX charsets
o has own address book
o and more features that you can evaluate yourself ;)

What do you need to run aMail?
------------------------------
o MiNT (is highly recomended, but the program works in SingleTOS or MagiC, too)
o AES at least version 3.40 (but without a MultiAES you can read messages
  only)
o OLGA Manager (needed for creating messages)
o Text editor which supports OLGA protocol (QED, Everest)
o 500 KB of free RAM
o MiNTnet or STinG/STiK or Draconis or IConnect (for sending and receiving mail)

We recommend:
-------------
o MiNT 1.15.x (http://www.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~fnaumann/mint/)
o N.AES 2.x (http://www.woller.com/)
o QED 4.5x (http://www.tu-harburg.de/~smcf1605/qed/main.html)

Some basic tips & hints: 
------------------------
1. If the program is placed on a minixfs/ext2fs partition and it doesn't run,
   check the settings of executable flag (rwx--x--x)
2. If you want to use a mailbox from Unix, just suck it (e.g. with aFTP client)
   and rename it to the $HOME/amail/inbox or open it from a menu
3. If you want to use a mailbox from Newsie, use the included script for converting.
4. Your text editor MUST support the OLGA protocol, because aMail sends the mail
   after getting the message "Save File" from the OLGA Manager. TempDir must 
   be written with the following format: drive:\dir\ and NOT /dir/ !
   
As a small bonus there is the script n2amail.sh for converting Newsie
mailboxes into the Unix format included to the package. Just run this script from 
your shell and it will ask for necessary paths. There is a script for sorting
address book in the package - just execute it and read instructions.

Start with a parameter or VA_START
----------------------------------
You may start aMail with a parameter from a command line or you may drop 
it by VA_START. The parameter must be of the URL form for mail sending
(e.g. "mailto: atack@szt.cdrail.cz"). You may add your subject separated
with a question mark
(e.g. "mailto: atack@szt.cdrail.cz?subject=Testmail"). You may start aMail
with .cfg file or mailbox file on the command line (or send a VA_START message).
With aMail version 1.22 and above you may add following command switches to the
command line:
-s : send messages in outbox
-g : get messages from POP3 server
-e : do exchange (send+get)
-q : quit after previous action(s)

   You can Drag&drop file to an aMail window. The file is used as a config file
(if the file is the config file) or is opened as a mailbox (if the file is 
the mailbox) or is taken as an attachment.

URL parsing
-----------
When you click into the message text, the clicked word will be analysed and in
case the word is in URL format (e.g. http://www.pwp.cz/atack) it will
be sent by VA_START to the corresponding application (in this case for example
CAB) with the assistance of URLSRV or StringServer.
URLSRV is freeware. It isn't included to the package, but you can get it 
from our WWW page.
Note: URLs are not highlighted yet!

Internal mailboxes
-------------------
   1) InBOX - every incoming message is saved here
   2) OutBOX - storage place for messages you wrote
   3) Sent-Mail - successfuly sent messages are moved to this box
   4) FileBOX - CTRL+O opened mailbox is here
   5) TempBOX - for internal use only ;)
   6) RemoteBOX - if you open this box online, you can look at a list
      of messages on a remote (your POP3) server. You can easily mark
      messages for deletion or retrieving or leave messages as are.
      Requested changes will be done when you:
      a) select another box
      b) select compress box
      c) select 'Get messages' (from menu or by clicking on a Get button)
      d) select 'Do' from an object menu
      
User defined mailboxes
----------------------
aMail can maintain up to 50 mailboxes. It has 6 internal mailboxes
(inbox, sent-mail, outbox, ...), so you can define up to 44 more. If you save
aMail's config, aMail will create a remarked 3-line example in the config file.

-- start ------------- part of amail.cfg file -----------
CustomBoxName = Atari CZ
CustomBoxPath = g:\home\root\amail\atari
DefaultTo = Atari@alpha.inf.upol.cz
RuleSet = To: Atari@alpha.inf.upol.cz
RuleSet = Reply-To: Atari@alpha.inf.upol.cz
CustomBoxName = Work-outbox
CustomBoxPath = g:\home\root\amail\work_out
CustomBoxType = 1
DefaultFrom = somebody@work.com
-- end --------------- part of amail.cfg file -----------

Here is a closer explanation of the keywords:
CustomBoxName - name of the mailbox. It will be displayed in the popup menu
              - compulsory keyword
CustomBoxPath - path and filename of a mailbox
              - compulsory keyword
CustomBoxType - you can set this mailbox as OUTBOX (CustomBoxType = 1)
DefaultTo     - in case you have opened this mailbox and created a new message
                this will put the string as the address of the recipient automatically
                (e.g. To: address)
DefaultFrom   - in case you have opened this mailbox and created a new message
                this will put the string as the address of the sender automatically
                (e.g. From: address)
RuleSet       - after the '=' mark you can write a rule for sorting the
                mail. The string is searched in the message header 
                and according to the rule the message will be sorted to the defined
                mailbox
   Functionality Notes:
   "To: honza" - the message will be passed into this mailbox if anywhere
      within their header on the line starting with "To:" and anywhere else 
      the string "honza" will be found (e.g. "To: Friend honza")
   "atari.com" - all messages which have the "atari.com" string 
      within their header will be passed into this mailbox
   It is also possible to create a so called blacklist (mail from
   anywhere will be deleted automatically), one example follows:
CustomBoxName = Black Hole
CustomBoxPath = /dev/null
RuleSet = From: scott spam

Object menu
-----------

This menu may be called by pressing the right mouse button over the message 
header (in the upper part of the window). Then you will work only 
with the message under the mouse pointer (which will be selected). You may
delete the message, move, or copy it to another mailbox (copy = move with 
pressed the SHIFT key), create a new message, reply the message, 
remove all flags or change the message (a new message is created, 
which you can edit and the old one will be marked as deleted) and so on.

STOP button
-----------

By this button you can stop the asock.ovl, which is fetching/sending 
mail by the time. Therefore you should use this button only when it is really 
needed! Usually when nothing happens for a long time (connection is lost) 
or e.g. when you realise that you are sending a message to a wrong 
person too late ;).

AV Protocol
-----------

aMail supports and uses many GEM protocols for comfort improvement. 
Except the minor ones like the FONT protocoll, UFSL, xFSL, Selectric, ... 
the main one is obviously the AV protocoll. The main purpose is the 
calling of external viewers for MIME attachments. In this case the 
icon in the upper right corner of the window becomes clickable and you 
can do one of the following things:

   1) click on the icon (single click)
      - a fileselector appears and you can choose the destination path 
        to save the attachment
   2) doubleclick the icon
      - the attachment is exported into the TMP directory and sent to the
        AV server. For example if you receive amail.lzh as a file 
        attachment and you have set the LZH-Shell for opening *.lzh files
        the LZH-Shell will be started with a file amail.lzh as an argument
   3) drag the icon and drop it on any disk icon, directory... on your 
      desktop and the attachment file will be saved directly to where you 
      have dropped it.

   If the file is encoded (and usually it really is) to one of the two 
   possible codes then it will be automatically decoded while writing. The 
   text is usually "quoted-printable" ('=3A' etc.) and binary files 
   are usually in base64 code (thick column of funny characters).

Keyboard
--------

Now we can describe the keys what can be used in aMail. Except the 
hotkeys which you can easily find in the menu the keys are:

Arrows Up/Down     - scrolls the message contents to next/previous line
Shift + Up/Down    - scrolls the message contents to next/previous page
Clr/Home           - jump to the start of the message
Shift + Clr/Home   - jump to the end of the message
Arrows Left/Right  - jump to next/previous message
SPACE              - jump to next page/message 
Shift + Left/Right - jump to next/previous page of the messages
Delete             - mark selected message for deletion
Insert             - mark selected message on POP3 server for download

Address book
------------

The basic function and maintenance of the address-book is hopefully 
clear to everybody, but what does the Group selection stand for? In general it 
makes the work with the Cc: or Bcc: copies more simple. So if you are 
sending messages to a constant (similar) group of recipients you 
need not write to all of them twice. You may write them all (their e-mail 
addresses) into a text file and then choose this file as a Group item 
in the addressbook. There must be only ONE address per line. The first 
address will be used as the primary address (to the To: field in the 
message header).

   You can create folders since aMail v1.23. The folder is defined (created)
by "Folder" keyword in an addressbook file. For example:

Username = ATARI maniac
Email = aman@atari.org
Folder = ATARI

Sounds
------

If the audio device driver (audiodev.xdd) is installed, aMail can play 
samples as a note about some events that may occur.

All samples must be raw sound data, mono, 8bit signed, 12500Hz.
If you don't want sounds, just 
a) uninstall the audio device ;) or
b) delete or rename all samples (sound/new.raw, sound/error.raw) or the
   sound/ directory.

Reply-to
--------

aMail knows how to handle the following variants of a message header.
Let's describe them:

   o The header contains only From:
     - without any other question this will be replied to the address
       from the From: field

   o The header contains only From: and To:, which doesn't correspond 
     to your e-mail address
     - the [From: | To: | All] dialog appears, where the [All] choice
       replies to the addresses from the From: and To: fields.

   o The header contains only From: and Reply-to:
     - the [From: | Reply-to | All] dialog appears, where the [All]
       choice replies to the addresses from the From: and Reply-to:
       fields.

   o The header contains only From: and Cc:
     - the [From: | Cc | All] dialog appears, where the [All]
       choice replies to the addresses from the From: and Cc: fields.

   o The header contains only From:, Reply-to and Cc:
     - the [From: | Reply-to | All] dialog appears, where the [All]
       choice replies to the addresses from the From:, Reply-to: and
       Cc: fields.

   If in the last three cases the address within the To: field doesn't
   correspond to your e-mail address (as in the 2nd case) then if you
   choose [All] then this address will be appended as well.

   In any other case the normal dialog for the header filling appears 
   (To:, Subject:, Cc:, attachment) and you may change anything you like.
    
Quote string
------------

You may define an own string, max. 10 chars (why longer, then it will 
be long over the half of a line ;) and more, you can use special formatting 
chars. Currently aMail distinguishes only %i as the name initials, e.g. if 
you reply a mail "From: Jan Evangelista Purkyne" and your quote 
string is "%i > ", all lines will begin with a "JEP > " string. Yep! ;)

MIME attachments
----------------

The type of an attachment will be automatically set during message sending
according to its file extension and the file mime.types, which will be searched
within the following directories (in this order):
1) /usr/local/share/mime.types
2) ~/.mime.types
3) ./mime.types

The file format is plain text, standard and simple ;)
--- mime.types ----
application/postscript  ps eps ai
image/gif               gif
image/jpeg              jpg jpeg jpe
text/html               htm html
text/plain              txt c h cc
--- mime.types ----

If the type is text/* the quoted-printable code will be used
as required for text files (containing ASCII character codes higher than 127
or if the lines are longer than 72 characters) or the base64 code if it
isn't a text file.

Sounds
------
   Sounds in aMail works only via /dev/audio. There will be support
for Gemjing or something like that in near future.

Pipes
-----
   The documentation about pipes is not available, sorry. But it's easy to use,
see our example.

an example:

 PToolName = Stats
   PToolCMD = grep "From:" | cut -d " " -f 2- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   PToolSRC = 0
   PToolMode = 1

Tools
-----
   Configuration and usage is very close to the pipes configuration.
   You have to define PToolName and PToolCMD keywords only (see example).

   You can use folowing macros on a command line:
   %c - actual config file
   %M - actual mailbox
   %m - actual message (the message will be exported)

an example:

 PToolName = Config in QED
  PToolCMD = D:\EDITORY\QED\QED.APP %c

   This tool opens actual config file in a QED window.

NNTP protocol - discussion groups
--------------------------------
   The goal of NNTP support in aMail is a nntp mailbox file is the same
as the e-mail mailbox file. You have to add nntp mailbox to your config
file with kewyword 'CustomBoxType = 2', ie.:

CustomBoxName = comp.sys.atari.st
 CustomBoxPath = g:\root\amail\comp.atari
 CustomBoxType = 2
 NNTPMsgs = 300

   An enhanced 'Get' popup menu is available in aMail by pressing right mouse
button on the Get icon.

Limitations
-----------

The number of messages in the mailbox is limited, but the number is given
in the config file (a text file) where you can edit them simply.
There are two numbers, one for the amount of memory to be reserved for 
message headers (default is 200kB which is sufficient enough ;) and the 
other one is the maximum number of messages in the mailbox (default is 
1000, maximum is 32768). Both numbers correspond and it would be 
possible to compute one according to the other one, but this way the 
programm is more configurable and the nations with short names may set 
different values, which we can't know, as they want ;)
If any of these limits are exceeded while the mailbox opening it 
will be interrupted and the mailbox is further locked as "read only" because 
the messages which wouldn't have fit in would be lost after mailbox closing. 
Therefore, the flags wouldn't be saved (read, new), the messages marked 
for deletion (even for move to other mailbox) wouldn't be deleted and 
also the mailbox couldn't be compressed.
Next limitation: messages forwarding works without forwarding of MIME attachments. 
(I hope we'll fix it soon)

Thanks
------

We would like to thank all betatesters who shared their expensive time in 
developing and helping with their suggestions and their advice. We want also 
thank to Christian Felsch for his QED - a great text editor. All sources of
aMail have been written with QED. And of course thanks to U2, Pink Floyd and 
to Stones for the best music for programming ;)

If aMail doesn't work just write down what it does or not, when and 
where and the versions of your system components (OS version, MiNTnet 
version, AES, free RAM at a start of aMail, environment variables 
setting, a bank account number ;-)) ...)
