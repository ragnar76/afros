		What's new in STZIP ?


Version 2.6         27 Apr 94
-----------------------------

Argl, some new bugs managed to introduce themselves in v2.5...

- First file in a zip didn't extract in Gem, fixed.
- Create directory in Gem had some new and different problems, fixed.
- Tempo directory name was cleared at the config box apparition, fixed
  (reported by Christophe Boyanique)
- Fixed the 'no file(s)' problem occuring randomly in CL when extracting
  files from a zip with subdirs (reported by Gerhard Hoelscher)
- It was impossible to extract only a file in CL if some files with same name
  are in subdirs of the zip. Fixed. (reported by Gerhard Hoelscher)
  Note however that using 'stzip -xr test readme' extracts all the readme
  files from the zip.
- Empty subdirectories were stored when using 'stzip -ar test readme'. Fixed.
  (reported by Gregor Duchalski)
- Maximum numbers of parameters in CL increased to 100.

Version 2.5          2 Apr 94
-----------------------------

- When extracting a file that already exists on disk, it is possible to
  rename it (in addition of skip/overwrite)
- It is possible to rename a compressed file in Gem (just edit the name).
- Compression using the Deflate algorithm is about 10% faster.
- File Selection Box scrolls when selecting multiple files
- Search backward available in file viewer
- It is now possible to compress/extract empty subdirs
- You may change the directory use for tempo files : use -b dir in command
  line or go in the config dialog box in Gem. See stzip.doc for detailed
  explanations.
- Added special buttons for picture display (2.4 was looking at the file
  extension to choose between internal/picture viewer).
- 3D buttons under MultiTOS.

- Fixed recursive compression in command line (Franck Arnaud)
- Finally fixed rename bug (was a compiler bug, really !)
- Fixed TRAP bugs (Harun Scheutzow)
- Fixed bug in 68881 MMFPU (Jan Kriesten)
- Fixed problem in moving main window while viewing a file (Eric Da Cunha)
- Fixed scroll in an overwritten (de)compression window (P&T Bensoussan)

Version 2.4         22 Dec 93
-----------------------------

- The file display feature now speaks to picture viewers (such as
  ShowView or GemView) to display the file as picture.
   - Install a picture viewer supporting the View protocol as an accessory
   - Set the View environment variable to the full name of that viewer
     (e.g. setenv View C:\GEMVIEW.ACC). This should be optionnal, if
     you don't set that variable, STZip will try to find the viewer by
     itself.
   - When clicking on the "Display" button in STZip, if the file is a
     picture that the viewer is able to display, STZip will ask you
     wether you want to display it as a picture.
   - When displaying a compressed file, it will be extracted in memory.
     The viewer should support the ViewData extension of the View protocol
     to be able to display that picture. ShowImage support that extension.
  If STZip don't ask you if you want to display the file as picture, this
  is because
	     - The viewer is not able to display that file
	     - You try to display a compressed file and the Viewer does not
	       support ViewData.


- If MiNT is present, STZip now runs as a MiNT domain process when used
  in *command line* (with the help of Evan Langlois) (Gem interface
  does not yet support that). This allows to compress files that don't
  fit in the limited DOS 8.3 filename format. As in previous version,
  STZip is able to extract long file names, both in command line and in
  Gem.

  Note that STZip may have some problems creating directories during
  extraction on alternate file systems (RAMFS or MINIXFS). This is a bug
  in the MiNT kernel which has been reported.

  If MiNT is present, filenames are case sensitives. Using common Atari
  zipfiles where filenames are all upper cases requires that you put in the
  command line the name of the file to extract in upper case.
  Use the -k option to set case insensitive mode.
  Note however that for security reasons, a file named 'ab' will overwrite
  'AB' in a zipfile.

- You can set frequently used options in command lines in an environnement
  variable named STZIP_OPT. STZip will simply add that variable at the
  beginning of the command line.
  e.g.    setenv STZIP_OPT -k
  so that STZip will always be in case insensitive mode.

- When creating a self extracting file, you may choose if the self
  extracting file will overwrite files during extraction without
  asking. Answer Yes to the question in Gem, or use the -o switch
  in command line if you want that.

- In the zip contents box, a point just before the file name means that
  there is a comment attached to that file.

- In Gem, it is possible to create a subdir in the zipfile. The program
  will ask you wether you want to create a subdir in the disk or in the
  zip when you click on "Create Subdir". Note that a subdir in a zipfile
  only exists if you put files in it. If you do not compress anything
  in it, the created subdir will not appear in the zipfile.

- Added a -q option in command line, it suppress all output.

- Fixed name truncation when compressing files with a very long path
  (reported by Georges-Emile April). Generally, using very long paths
  should work better.
- Fixed crash when inflating files in command line using MultiTOS
  (reported by Stefan Haake).
- Fixed problem when self extracting files contains subdirectories with
  short names (reported by Steven Ourada).
- Fixed various and/or random problems when STZip was started as an
  application (reported by steve j and Sebastian Ludorf)
- Finally fixed problem with MetaDOS
- Fixed division by zero bombing when displaying a short text file (reported
  by Scott Dowdle, Dirk Steins and Morgan Stewart)
- Fixed problem when self extracting files contains individual comments
  (reported by Roger Derry)
- Fixed List contents to printer when using Gem (reported by Willem
  Mulder and Roger Derry)
- Fixed bug in File Display / Save when the user set the block start after
  the block end
- Directories weren't deleted on modern TOS when using delete in Gem.
  Fixed. (reported by Eric Da Cunha)
- Default font size in file display is now 9 instead of 10. (Steve Taylor)
- Fixed bug when clicking on the full box of the file display window.
  (Peter Seitz)
- Fixed problem with CRC when extracting on a PC empty files compressed on ST
  (reported by Markus Fischer).
- Bypass incompatibily (sign of offset in Fseek(o,2)) of some MiNT file
  systems (Evan Langlois).
- Finally fixed rename bug.
- In rare occasions, an error message was wrongly produced when
  deleting compressed files (Move option) (Dirk Steins).

Version 2.3         22 Jul 93
-----------------------------

- Added a listing option in Gem for users who can't ever use the command line
- Added keyboard shortcuts for the main dialog (since auto programs such as
  LetThemFly don't work on that special window/dialog)

- The resource file has been damaged in v2.2, that caused a lot of troubles
  in Gem (file display, comment editing...). Fixed
- STZip was sometimes reporting corrupted files when using the 'Check' function
  while they were correct (reported by Robert Federle)
- No more limits of 200 files in the file selectors.
- Self extracting files now prompts before overwriting files.
- When moving files, the subdirectories weren't deleted. Fixed. (reported
  by Richard Karsmakers and Ghlenn Willard)
- Fixed problems when using Update on zips with subdirs (Gregor Duchalski)
- Fixed problems about extensions with createdir/file rename (Ivan Venturi)
- Sorting a zipfile with size wasn't working (reported by Renker)
- When deleting a subdirectory on the disk, the exact number of files
  is displayed on the prompt Yes/No.
- Fixed bug with MetaDOS (unchecked) (reported by Julian Reschke)
- Fixed bug about the -p option (reported by Markus Dobler)
- Minor fixes in error handling, File Display (key assignement, speed...)

- I suppose there's no more problem with dialog boxes on TT, I gave up
  trying to save the screen, it is now redrawn after a dialog.

Version 2.2         12 Feb 93
-----------------------------

A few new features ...

- Added block operation in File Display. You may now select a block
  and save it, print it or copy it to the clipboard. It is also
  possible to print the entire file. Press the HELP key (or double click
  in the window) during display to select on a function or to find the
  keyboard shortcuts.
- On modern desktop, droping a file (which is not a zipfile) on the STZip
  icon will open a zipfile with a similar name (e.g. FLAP.ZIP if you dropped
  FLAP.PRG). STZip will use the path of the file as the current directory.
- New option "Go in Current Dir" in configuration : rather than using the
  file directory saved in the configuration file (for choosing the zipfile
  and the files to compress), STZip choose the current directory.
- Default compression algorithm is now Deflating.
- Font ID and size used for file display are now saved in the configuration
  file.

and a few fixes...

- When selecting zip or disk files (_not_ subdirs), the total selected size
  was displayed. It now scans recursively subdirectories to find their sizes.
- Rename in Gem was buggy, Ghlenn Willard.
- Fixed small compatibility problems with PKZip 2.04 (crypt and inflate)
- Fixed bugs in medium resolution display (reported by dmviolat)
- Displaying a crypted file wasn't working, reported by Theo Runia and
  Carsten Brockman
- Fixed problem in Gem when two subdirs in the zipfile begins with the
  same characters, reported by Carsten Brockmann
- Fixed problems in file display with some font size, reported by Christian
  Limpach
- Fixed memory bug when deflating lots of very small files (Ghlenn Willard)

and a few minor fixes.
I had reports about problems with dialog boxes on TT, I've changed a few
things but I cannot check so I don't know if it's ok or not. If there are
still some problems, try removing the TT flags in the program header. That
may fix the problem.

Version 2.1         27 Dec 92
-----------------------------

- The main dialog is now in a window, this should be better for
  MultiTOS users.
- Updated the main documentation (the old one was very outdated)
- Speed up inflating on self extracting files, it was slower than inflating
  the sfx file from STZip !
- Extended the limits of a zipfile, it is now possible to have up to
  65536 files in a zip, assuming you have the memory to handle them.
- Added a switch to suppress queries when deleting files, and a Rename
  button when looking at a file (after a double clic).
- Added a -g flag in Command Line and a button in the Config box in Gem
  to extract a file in its corresponding directory. If selected, all files
  from FFF.ZIP will be extracted in the directory FFF.
- Wildcards for the zipfile in command line are allowed (but be sure that
  your shell doesn't expand them because it won't work). You can do
     stzip -xg *.zip    this will extract all the zip files in their directory
  or stzip -z *.zip <comment.txt  this will change the zip comments for all
  the zipfiles. (note that -z may now be used alone, without any action
  switch).
- Support of the slighlty different crypting algorithm of Unix's Info-Zip.

All other changes are bug fixes :

- Fixed a bug in deflation (giving CRC errors)
- Fixed a memory problem when checking zip files, reported by willy.
- Fixed 'Display free disk space on TOS<1.4' which wasn't working,
  reported by Vincent Partington.
- Do not bomb when clicking on Select: 0 with an empty zip file, reported by
  Pierre-Alain Boucard.
- Fixed small problems in the display window after a font size change.
- A CRC error was wrongly produced when displaying a large deflated file,
  this is fixed, reported by Ghlenn Willard.
- Fixed problems with 'Allocating twice outbuffers', Ghlenn Willard.
- When a file is compressed and then deleted (because the 'Move' option is
  enabled), the file selection box wasn't updated, again Ghlenn Willard.
- Fixed the "Sort by extension" option in Gem, it was sorting wrongly the
  filenames. Nobody was using this ?
- Specifiying a file with a path during extraction/delete in CL was buggy,
  as well as giving a directory name for compression.
- Fixed problem with freshen/update when dealing with subdirectories.
- Since I had a lot of questions asking "What is ZIPJR for?", I've removed
  it from the distribution. Tell me if you used it.

Version 2.0          15 Aug 92
------------------------------

Summary of changes, from most important to small bug fix, since version 1.1 :


- New compression algorithm
  -------------------------
  
  Named 'Deflating', it compress better than imploding and is
  compatible with the upcomming PKZIP 2.0. At this time, PKZIP 2.0 is not
  released, but an alpha version with deflating, v1.93, is available.

  Using a command line, you may select this algorithm with the -ed option.
  The default algorithm, for this version, is still Imploding.
  Using the Gem interface, you may select this algorithm in the Config
  dialog box.

  This algorithm has three variants : one that compress faster but not so good,
  one medium, and one which compress best but slowly. There are buttons to
  select the one you want in Gem. Using a command line, -edf gives you the
  fast one, -edb the best one, and -ed the medium.

  Note that at the time of the release, not all versions of ZIP on all
  computers are able to extract deflated files.


- Self extracting file support
  ----------------------------

  You may use ZIP2TOS.PRG to convert a zip file to a .TOS program which
  will contains the compressed files and will extract them when launched.

  Without parameters, you will be prompted for the file to convert. You may
  also calls it with the zipfile names in parameters, from the desktop (drag
  a file) or a shell (zip2tos *.zip)

  A self extracting file should contains _only_ deflated or stored files. It
  will be unable to explode or unshrink files. This is _not_ checked when
  ZIP2TOS does the conversion.

  A self extracting file may be used as a normal zip file. Using STZip >1.3,
  you will be able to change the comments, list, extract, add or delete
  compressed files in the self extracting file.


- Crypting and uncrypting files
  -----------------------------

  A compressed file inside a zip may be crypted. STZip use the same
  algorithm as PKZIP, 

  You may specify a password using the -w switch when using the command
  line interface, or by clicking in the "Crypt box" in the Gem interface.
  The files to be compressed will be encrypted using that password.

  That password will be also used when extracting files. If you forgot
  to specify it and STZip encounter a crypted file, it will prompt you.

  (i.e. : if you compress files using password BURP and extract them
  without leaving STZip, STZip won't prompt you for the password since it
  still has BURP in mind).

  STZip is also able to tell you if the password supplied for extracting a
  file is wrong. Note that the password is not stored in the file (would be
  stupid!).


- Updating and freshening a zipfile
  ---------------------------------

  'Adding' would compress all the selected files, wether they are already
  in the zip or not.
  
  Three new modes are available :

 -Freshening : only specified files that are already in the zip and are
        newer than those in the zip will be added.
 -Updating : only specified files that are already in the zip and are
         newer than those in the zip, _AND_ the specified files that are
         not in the zipfile will be added.
 -Using a date line : only the files changed after the specified date will
         be added.

To use that in Gem, click on the 'Add Mode' box, and select what you want.
To use that in a command line,
   freshening is -f : stzip -f backup *.c
   updating is -u   : stzip -u galery *.gif
   date line is -t  : stzip -a -t011692 fip *.prg
      Will add all *.prg files created or changed after Janury 16th 1992.
      Note the US date format !

- Minor changes
  -------------

  - Added 'Delete original files' in the Config box in the Gem interface. If
    selected, the original files on disk will be deleted after compression.

  - In Gem, new window for displaying information, so that it should be
    possible to compress in background using MultiTOS.

  - STZip checks for its configuration file in its home directory
    using shell_find. I think that doesn't work on TOS < 1.4.

  - STZip detects files packed with Ice and Atom and does not try to compress
    them (infos supplied by David Ducassou). Also checks files packed with
    compress, freeze and PfxPack as does older versions.

  - Added 'Check Zipfile' in the Gem interface. That checks if the zip
    file extracts correctly.

  - If you're in the zip directory DIR while in Gem, the files you may compress
    will be put in that directory. That's not new, the news is that you may do
    the same using the command line interface, by using the -i option :
    stzip -a burp -i dir *.*
    will add all files in the directory dir OF the zip file.

  - File attributes are handled : stzip will also adds hidden and system files,
    and will extract those files with their original file attributes.

  - Added an option to force the free disk space display on Tos < 1.4
    (this is generally slow).

  - More drive letters in Gem.

  - Redirection >AUX: is now possible using the command line interface

- Bug fixes
  ---------

  - Fixed bug when extracting 0 length files on TOS 2.x and 3.x, reported
    by Gianfranco Marino and willy.
  - Fixed bug when displaying files with lines separated by CR, reported
    by Robert Eckardt.
  - STZip wasn't adding the default .ZIP extension when the file name typed
    in the file selector was just 8 characters long (Robert Eckardt).
  - Fixed bug with vro_cpyfm, reported by Wilfried Behne
  - In Gem, the zip size is now updated after a delete, reported by willy
  - It is now possible to display a Stored file in the display window

Version 1.1          14 Jan 92
------------------------------
Well... Some bugs in 1.0 needed to be unimplemented ! :-(
- Fixed incompatibility bug with PKUNZIP happening sometimes
- Corrected bug when changing the zipfile after having edited the
  comments of the old one (was overwriting the new one)
- You may now add a file in a subdir of a zipfile, it will be compressed
  with the correct path (it was added in the root of the zip file before).
- Corrected bug when compressing many files in .TTP
- The path stored in the config file wasn't used in some functions (resulting
  in disk selector containing directories of a path and files of another one !)
  fixed (reported by willy)
- Fixed bugs with MultiGEM reported by Peter Kocourek
- Fixed bug when displaying files with lines ending with LF only (not CR LF)
- Improved file display (horizontal slide etc)
- Faster compression on highly redondant file (was very slow)
- Only ESC stops compression or decompression (before any key was stopping)
. Added confirmation when deleting a file on disk.
. Fixed bug when PATH was empty
. Fixed bug when zip file name was >45 chars

--=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=---=--

Version 1.0           28 Dec 91
-------------------------------
- New implementation of the Imploding algorithm. It is now faster
  (especially for text files) and uses less memory.
- You may display files in a window, compressed or uncompressed !
  Press HELP for help (search string, save file, clipboard, change fonts)
- Added edition of comments in GEM.
- Delete files in zip and overwrite file in zip is supported both in GEM
  and TTP.
- Included resource in the program and added color support.
- Fixed problem with zipfile being sometimes corrupted when adding a file
- Added handling of a config file. It is loaded automatically if found and
  may be saved in the dialog box 'configuration'. It contains also the
  directory where to find zipfiles (used in the file selector) and the 'DISK'
  path.
- Included english and german translations of the documentation made by
  Peter Kocourek and Juergen Kiesheyer. Thanks to both !
- With new features and inclusion of the resource in the program, stzip.prg
  has largely grown in size. People not using GEM might be low in memory or
  might want to reduce loading time, so I included ZIPJR.TTP, which is a
  command line only version of STZIP, without GEM handling. Features are
  exactly the same.
- Added check archive (-c) and extract files to screen (-s) in command line.
- Faster scroll in the window when compressing/extracting in GEM
- On TOS < 1.4, doesn't display free disk space because it's slow
- You may stop compression/decompression in GEM by pressing a key
  (it will only take effect when displaying something)
- Delete original files after compression (ie : -am) works as expected in TTP.
- Disable FormDoIt on some buttons (file names etc) so that there's no
  alt-key bindings on these buttons.
- Fixed problem with files packed with PKZIP and authenticity verification
- Fixed compatibility problem with some versions of UNZIP (<3.0)
Bugs :
- When LTMF 1.14 is active, pressing a key to stop compression in Gem
  doesn't work.
- Selection on multiple file (by keeping mouse button pressed) doesn't
  work as expected when FormDoIt is active.
- Display a file in GEM which was Stored is not yet possible.

Version 0.9      19 Jun 91
--------------------------
This is a bug fix version.
-Fixed problem (was terribly slow and bad ratio) with imploding highly
 compressible files (such as data base etc).
-Fixed problem computing CRC when imploding small files.
-Fixed problem with AMCGDOS ('invalid handle').
-Fixed problem with zip file of length 0.
-Can select multiple files in one clic in Gem.
-'@list' option in command line and redirection without shell are working now.
-Handles errors in GEM and in Implode correctly.
-Added ARGV support in command line.
-Can set a zip file comment from a file using '<' redirection
 (e.g. stzip -az file.zip dummyfile <bbs.txt)

The following 'bugs' are known and will be corrected as soon as possible :
- support of all screen resolutions
- delete/update files in a zip
- changing comments in gem
- store file when the compressed data is larger than the original
- the -m option should be considered as unimplemented. it only does a
  Fdelete on the parameter, without handling directory change, wildcards,
  ~ and @

Version 0.8       9 May 91
--------------------------
Fixed compatibility problem with PKUNZip/Implode, doesn't compress better
than PKZip anymore :-(
You can use the old incompatible compression algorithm with the -ej
switch. It is strongly suggested not to use it unless you are sure
nobody will extract the file on a PC.
Hope to increase compression ratio in next release.

Version 0.7      21 Apr 91
--------------------------
Big text files couldn't implode without bombing, fixed.

Version 0.6       4 Apr 91
--------------------------
Imploding is now the default algorithm, and detects text files to use
better parameters. Added drive buttons.

Version 0.5       3 Apr 91
--------------------------
Added imploding, use the -ei switch to select it in command line, or go in
the configuration box in gem.

Version 0.4      29 Dec 90
--------------------------
Compiler change, stzip.prg is 22k smaller. Added disk format.

[sleeping]

Version 0.3      1 Jun 90
-------------------------
Bugs changed, Comments. -z (set zipcomment) and -t (set zipfile date)
switchs added.

Version 0.2   30 April 90
-------------------------
Shrinking is nearly 65% faster.
Many bugs removed. No more limitation in the number of files added.
Added a -e switch to select the compression method (currently, only -es
(store only) is useful), and a -p switch to store paths when not
recursing into subdirs.

Version 0.1    5 April 90
-------------------------
First beta release.
