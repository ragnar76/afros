           STZIP version 2.6
           -----------------

STZip is an archiver that can process .ZIP files, like PKZip does on
IBM PC's. It can extract files from and add files to an archive, it
is fast and it uses gem. It can also compress subdirectories and store
comments into the archive, even for any file inside the archive.

You can use STZip from a shell or a program with a command line (type
stzip -? to get some help), or within its built-in gem shell (start
stzip.prg from desktop). You can also install it as a gem application
on the desktop, for file with extension '.ZIP'. STZip will open the
zipfile when you double click on it.

See the file WHATSNEW for a list of recent changes.

You may copy this program and put it for download on bulletin boards.
Commercial use and distribution (this includes putting STZip or self-
extracting files made by STZip on anything that is sold for more than
the cost of the disk and/or handling charges) is not authorized without
agreement of the author. You use this program at your own risk, there
is no warranty.

Please avoid to "repackage" STZip, I prefer that the users gets all
the original files in the distribution.
