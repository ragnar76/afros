 Description
________________


	The purpose of this program is to automatically create links of 
	directories and files and to delete links of drives on drive U, on every 
	system startup of MagiC. Especially I recommend to remove the link to 
	drive A on drive U on original Atari hardware because each time the 
	root directory of drive U is accessed, MagiC accesses every drive which 
	is accessible through it. The consequence is a rather annoying delay 
	because of the slow disk drive.

	This program is only meant for use on MagiC, because on MiNT resp. 
	MultiTOS a comparable functionality is provided through the mint.cnf 
	file.




 Installation
________________


	1.	Copy link2u.prg to the 'start'-folder of MagiC.

	2.	Copy link2u.cnf to the HOME directory or into the directory 
		from where link2u.prg is started.
		Firstable, the program looks in the HOME directory for the 
		configuration file, if HOME exists, and then in that directory 
		from which link2u.prg has been started.

	3.	Customize link2u.cnf to fit your needs (see next chapter).




 link2u.cnf
________________


	Each command begins in the first column of a line and is terminated by 
	the end of the line. The arguments have to be separated from each other 
	by exactly one space character (ASCII code 32).

	The following commands are possible:

		#<comment>

			Any comment <comment> until end of line.

		sln <source> <target>

			Creates the symbolic link <target> of the original file 
			<source>. <source> and <target> must be the whole paths 
			of the files.
			Generally, this makes only sense if the target drive is 
			U, because links on real harddisk drives are not lost 
			on system shutdown, as it is the case on drive U, and 
			therefore don't have to be re-created on each system 
			startup.

		delu x

			Removes link to drive X from drive U.


	Example file:

		# Create link to directory D:\PROGRAMM\gnu\usr
		# from u:\usr
		#
		sln D:\PROGRAMM\gnu\usr u:\usr

		# Remove link to drive A from drive U.
		#
		delu a
