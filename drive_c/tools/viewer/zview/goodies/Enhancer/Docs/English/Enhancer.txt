VDI-Enhancer V1.00
==================

   VDI-Enhancer extends the ATARI VDI with new VDI functions for managing   
   off-screen bitmaps and with the function vq_scrninfo().

   In addition it replaces on Falcons in High-color mode (or True- color as 
   it is called by ATARI :-) the non-working function v_get_pixel().

Installation:
=============
   To install Enhancer, you have to copy it into your AUTO folder. If you   
   use SPDOGDOS, Enhancer must be physically after SPDOGDOS.

Note:
=====
   Enhancer shouldn't be used with NVDI because the provided functions 
   already exists in NVDI 2.5 and older NVDI versions do not support 
   monochrome bitmaps when working with color modes.
