This program is freeware. Anyone may copy it privately and
pass on to whomever he wants, as long as the archive is complete and
remains unchanged and no fee is charged.

This archive should contain at least:

- ORCS.PRG
  The program.
- ORCS.RSC
  The resource, english and german version.
- ORCSCF.PRG
  The program compiled by GNU-C, for a ColdFire V4e processor.
  Completely untested.
- ORCSEN.{HYP,REF}
  HyperText help file, english version.
- ORCSDE.{HYP,REF}
  HyperText help file, german version.
- EXTRA
  A folder containing some example code.
- MODULES
  External modules that can be used by ORCS. 
  These include modules to display extended object types,
  as well as the export modules from ResourceMaster.
  They are only included for completeness, almost all
  of their functionality is also builtin into the program,
  so if you are short on memory, or experience problems
  using them, it is safe to rename or remove this folder.
- TEMPLATE
  Template files that are used to generate the several
  output source files. 
- README
  this file


Of course I can not assume any liability for any direct or
indirect damage - including but not limited to
material or financial - arising by the use of
ORCS or the unsuitability of ORCS for a particular purpose.
