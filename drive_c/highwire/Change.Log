__________________________________________________
Changes in V. 0.2.4 release  of December 25, 2004:

- When a config file was created because none was
  found at program start the user gets a
  notification now.  Furthermore, the path of the
  loaded file is displayed on the page reachable
  with the "about:" pseudo-URL now.

- New config keyword START_PAGE to define what
  should be displayed after program start.
  NOTE:  This option will be ignored at the very
  first start of a new installed version.

- When the option 'Cookies allowed' in the menu
  get changed this will be stored in the config
  file.

- The menu bar got changed:  'Suppress Images' was
  removed (still useable from config file) and
  instead 'View Images' and 'Use CSS' were added.
  Both of the latter are stored in the cfg file.

- Functionality added to handle GEM dialogs inside
  of windows.
  Currently only the dialog from SHFT-CTRL-O uses
  this.

  graphic card drivers added.  Now images will
  appear with correct colours (#0101).

  program start to avoid problems with some AESs.

  loops due to empty or not found CSS files.

- Fixed loading of very short files which got lost
  due to wrong handling.

- Added an extra check for images that were tryed
  to load from a HTTPS source, this could cause

  from cache instead.

- Improved palette parsing for XPMs, to get more
  types of such images decoded.

- Bug #0101 resolved.

__________________________________________________

  AREA/USEMAP that is) for all three area types
  rectangle, circle and polygone (#0078/#0128).
  This includes also support for <A HREF> tags
  used rather then <AREA>, as defined by HTML 4.0
  (not even supported by IE5/Netscape/CAB).

- Support added for <INPUT type=image> form
  elements (#0173).

- Scroller buttons implemented for popup menus
  which doen't fit to the desktop height.  Not
  that fancy done yet but at least it useable so
  far (#0147/#0175).

- Bugfix for text input field width setting.  They
  were always set to a minimum width of 20 chars
  even if a smaller width was defined in the tag.

- Image formats XBM and XPM (X11 bitmap/pixmap)
  implemented.  These formats are very rare
  nowadays but still used by some stone old server
  (eg. the NCSA one) and all other browsers
  support at least the first format (even CAB
  does).

- Support added for web access via a proxy server.
  This can be controlled by using the keyword
     HTTP_PROXY = <proxy-ip> <port>
  in the highwire.cfg file.

- Bugs #0078, #0128, #0147, #0173, #0175 resolved.

__________________________________________________
Changes in V. 0.2.2 release  of October 31, 2004:

- Large portions of the cache handling code
  reworked.  This gets rid of several wrong
  warnings about not found files (mostly due to
  login pages for forums).

- Image width/height are saved in the disk cache
  now, this reduces reformat flickering on
  re-visited pages to the nearly absolute minimum
  (#0133).

- The window handling code also got a large rework
  to have non-modal dialog windows in the future.
  As a little gimmick the F10 key does the same now
  as the F11 does in Mozilla/IE.

- An ugly hack was added to get yahoo's buggy
  standard login working (the non-ssl version).

- CTRL-V can be used now to paste text from the
  clipboard into formular input fields.

- Named character recognition added for
  apostroph.

- More types of corrupted jpeg image data are
  catched now, instead of aborting.

- Improved detection of system type (AES + kernel),
  now XaAES is recognized also.  This also allows
  to get rid of the window fuller bug with XaAES
  (#0150, #0167).

- Some error messages are displayed by alert boxes
  now instead of console output or simple writing
  to the screen

- Workaround added for weird <base href=...>
  constructs, where the complete document path is
  used as the base (wrong usage that is, but also
  used by the W3C staff!).

- Additional filtering method to detect images
  that has a particulare directory name in their
  URL.  This method is used if the search pattern
  starts with a '/'.  Eg.
     RESTRICT_HOST I /ads/
  matches all images that has '/ads/' somewhere
  in their path.

- Bugs #0133, #0148, #0150, #0167, #0169, #0170,
  #0176, #0177 resolved.

  lost when more than one was defined.

- Added handling for wrong opend/closed formulars
  regarding table structures.

  be done with CTRL+TAB.

  over remote connections.
  NOTE:  This will only work when the CACHEDIR is
  defined properly in HighWire's cfg file!!!

- New config keyword added to control how much
  memory shall be used for caching of image
  bitmaps in memory (not those on disk):
    CACHEMEM = <kilo bytes>
  When not defined 100k will be assumed.
  (see example.cfg\highwire.cfg for details).

  displaying of images, especially for GrayScale

  objects (#0126).

  protocol was given in the URL of the button bar

  prevent HighWire from hanging due to not
  responsing servers.

  or iconified windows (#0118).

  indicate how busy HighWire is with loading and
  rendering.

  entities from code page 1252 (&#128; .. &#159;).

__________________________________________________
Changes in V. 0.1.4 release  of August 10, 2003:

- Implemented disk caching of text/html files from
  remote (only per session yet).  To enable this

  the line
    CACHEDIR = <path>
  where <path> must be a valid and writeable
  directory.

- Added a new config keyword to define the default
  background colour for pages that doesn't define
  any:
    DFLT_BACKGND = <colour>
  (see example.cfg\highwire.cfg for details).

  loading to be stopped.  The same function is
  implemented for the escape key now as well.

  due to frames that are loaded from a different
  server than the frameset.  Furthermore slider

  relative links in a document).

- Sound files from remote sites are now loaded
  also and can be played by external players.

- Fixed a problem with tables which were over-lapping other objects.

- Reworked config parser for faster program start
  on slow machines.

- Fixed a bug that was messing up the scheduler's
  job queue.

- Implemented handling of shift + left/right
  cursor keys (page-wise horizontal scrolling).

  now in the same way as N.AES does (for left and
  right mouse button).

- New menu entry (under 'Options') to have frames
  always resizeable and scrollbars if necessary,
  even if the HTML defines anything else there.
  The default is off but can be set to on with the
  keyword FORCE_FRAMECTRL = 1 in the config file.

- New keyword FONT_MINSIZE to define a minimum
  font height in points, eg. for <font size=1>
  (see example.cfg\highwire.cfg for explanation).

  tags with large refresh URLs.

- Improved calculation of percent and fractional
  frame size values, makes it much more robust
  against faulty frameset tags.

  and after lists.

- Corrected handling of table cells with both
  colspan and rowspan set.

- Re-implemented <div> tag rendering to tables
  with one single cell, matches their meaning much
  more now than the previous implementation.

- Added resetting of font characteristics after
  tables and title tags, this was messing up the
  renderer while calculating text word widths
  (only rarely seen on some very simple pages).

- Set texts of buttons and input fields always to
  black.

- Removed several code redundancies.

- Bugs #0041, #0096, #0098, #0102, #0103, #0104,
  #0105, #0106, #0108, #0109, #0110 resolved.
