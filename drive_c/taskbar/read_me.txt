Taskbar 4.10 BETA
---------------------------------------------------------------
Taskbar is a Windows-like taskbar, with a list of all running 
applications and a start-menu.

This is a BETA release, which means that there's probably a few
bugs to iron out. Please report any problems as accurately as
possible. I need atleast a description of your system (operating
system, desktop, kernel etc) and a list of ALL running
applications and TSRs.

Se TASKBAR.HYP for a list of changes since the last release.


Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------
Taskbar currently work on XaAES, N.AES and MagiC. It works best
with XaAES and N.AES, MagiC lacks some important features Taskbar 
needs.

Taskbar NEEDS an AV-server for most of its features. It has
been tested successfully with Thing, Jinnee 2 and Teradesk.
Don't attempt to use Taskbar without an AV-server!

It's also recommended to have ST-Guide or a compatible program
to read Taskbar's documentation (Taskbar.hyp).


Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------
Copy Taskbar.hyp and Taskbar.ref to the folder where you keep
your hypertexts. Run taskbar.prg. It's recommended to keep a
backup of your previous installation in case this beta doesn't
work for you.

Configuration, bugs, questions etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Please refer to Taskbar.hyp. If you can't find what you're
looking for there, send me a mail.
