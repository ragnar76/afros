In this directory there are the JAY Groups II demo scripts written
in Scripter language.
 
Please run the PLGTST.SIC as the first one. (If you didn't ran the
README.SIC) It will create the PLGTST.GRP file that you can drag onto
JAY Groups II application and then you can run the other scripts
directly from it.
 
None of the test scripts is destructive, so don't be affraid to run
it on any group file you have.
 
For more information see the .SIC files headers.
